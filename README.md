# Making Bioimaging/Data Science github repositories more open

[github] repositories are full of useful code and stuff. Unfortunately, some exist which do not have a license file attached to it, limiting reusuability in the sense of the [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) - and from a copyright perspective. Hence, I was creating some issues on such repositories asking developers to add a license file. In most cases they were happy about that input and acted accordingly.

This repository just serves hosting [a github issue](https://github.com/NFDI4BIOIMAGE/licensing/issues/1) where all those license-related issues are listed and can be tracked :-)
